# Advent of code 2020

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles. They may not be the most efficient or the most ingenious solutions, but they all should produce the correct answer reasonably quickly.

To get the solutions create a file named `input_##.txt`, where `##` stands for the number of the day with a leading 0 if necessary, in the relevant folder and run the file with the name starting with `day_`. I'm using Python 3.8, although many of the solutions should work on lower versions as well.

Feel free to start a discussion if you have any questions or open an issue if you find any errors.
